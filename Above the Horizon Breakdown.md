Main antagonist

Sidekick, 

---- 

**World building** - Set in the future. Genetic engineering has resulted in speciation of humans, with the massively wealthy modifing their childrens’ genetics to have all desirable traits. The results in a caste of super-humans who are highly intelligent, good looking, and healthy. It does not mean they are necessairly of high moral fiber. Exceptional individuals can manifest semi-divine powers seen in historical religions, such as seeing the future, telekinesis water, transmuting elements, and communicating to others through their dreams. 
Nobles live in space, and have created laws only allowing those of high genetic stock to be allowed to live in space. Hero figures out she is half noble, so can infiltrate noble society.
Eva - Hero of the story. Cannot trust others. Growing up in the underworld of the dystopian underworld of Earth. Lives in the city New Paradise, located in Antartica. Becomes ideologically posessed by a marxist ideology which portrays the nobles as soulless opressors and plebs as the heroic opressed underclass.
Eva is bitter because she was abused in the orphanage growing up.  Unknown to her, she is of half noble blood. Also purification squads attacked where she lived and killed many of her friends and the orphanage, forcing her to live on the streets by herself.
Motivation - Revenge against nobles for allowing her and so many others to suffer. She was told her parents were killed by the nobility as well. Her father is actually not dead, but a high ranking noble. Mother was commoner and was killed, but father spared Eva and put her in orphanage.
Her motivation develops throughout the story, turning from genocidal resentment and inability to trust, into love for others and willingness to be courageous enough to trust others. Turns into motivation of love, to bring things together. Save the world by bringing things together. Her noble power is connected to this, creating a portal between two points in space time to bring them together. Starts with only being able to teleport small objects or listen to sound or see at a distance or through walls, but ends with opening portals to move a fireteam through.
She can only create portals with any degree of accuracy for the location to areas that she can see. This can potentially be extended for the heist for example. It is very dangerous for her to step through a portal long distances, since she could teleport into an object which would kill her. She doesn’t know exactly where the end is until she steps through it.
There needs to be cost for creating portals. It could make her go insane? Or it could make her very hungry?
Adam - Alternate male hero. Love interest. 
Lucifer - Initially seen as the saviour figure for plebs. Extremely charasmatic. Pushes marxist type ideology. Sees nobles as opressors that need to be shaken off, as a dog shakes off fleas. Eventually leads to hatred and destruction to kill all nobles.
Aelius - Eva’s father. Honorable tribune of earth defence fleet. Has moral failings in past, had affair with prostitute that led to Eva. 
Noble leader - Similiar to Grendenwald character played by Johnny Depp. Thinks those who are noble should control the world for the good of humanity. Not hating those of lower genetic stock as ‘the beast of burden will always be needed’. Extremely charismatic. 
Develop characters and important is their motivations.
Each step should have victory then failure, or setup to next step.
Act 1
Goal
Find enough food to survive in the Blade Runner-esque underworld of New Paradise. Eva is part of underclass officially referred to as plebeian. The derogatoary slang is plebs.
Fail
Eva is caught stealing food from a market, and thrown into a jail.
Eva is interrogated, in a room of mirrors. She meets her lawyer, who tells her she will be held indefinitely until they can figure out what to do with her since she has no chip, and has never been registered with government. She says that she has no legal rights since she is not a citizen. The lawyer tells her that she is to be assumed to be a refugee from an old country, which are now deserts. Eva is held in a refugee facility, even though she was born in the country but just never registered by the government. (she was not given a chip since her birth was hidden, since she is half noble)
Fail
Eva becomes friends with the refugees, finding out their back stories. They come from various old countries, which are in a very bad state since sea levels have risen and they are mostly deserts. Refugees take extreme measures to try to get to Antartica, one of the few habitable spots left on Earth, many dying in the process. The refugees are part of a freedom fighter group
She shows one of a refugees, who becomes a mentor figure, that she has a basic noble power. He trains her how to use it to a basic extent. He tells her that a group of the refugees are planning on escaping from the facility. She says she cannot trust them. The mentor tells her sadly to meet at location if she makes it out alive and back into New Paradise.
Succeed
There is an orbital strike on the refugee facility, which causes chaos. Eva uses her noble power trick that she learned from her mentor to break into the hospital ward. She then implants a chip into herself. She looks at the readout on her arm, and gasps when it shows her number as 187 - over the required 183 to be noble. This means she can be part of the upper class and would be allowed to travel into space. She steals a hover car, bypassing guards by showing that she is noble at which point they give her deference, then descends from the mountain into the city of new paradise.
Act 2
Master her noble powers. Discover that her father was not killed by nobles but actually is a noble. Mentor or saviour tells her eventually that for her to have noble powers she has to have noble blood in her, and her mother was a commoner.
Meets saviour figure, who’s plan is to infiltrate noble society and end distinction between noble and earth humans. 
Goal
Master earth society, which means New Paradise and the underworld. Learn how to use her found powers. Goal is to get into space in order to infiltrate noble society to take them down, since nobles killed Eva’s parents.
Fail
Work with Lucifer to develop her powers. She cannot use properly at first and has setbacks. Eva finds it difficult to trust teammates.
Fail
Lucifer details plans to steal AI fleet from nobles, then turn it against them. Eva is enlisted as her unique ability to teleport objects will be used to break into control facility.
Eva starts to develop relationships with teammates. Develops romantic interest with Adam, but they have fight and break off relationship when he suggests that some nobles can be good people, as one showed him kindness when he was young. Adam tells her that she must be part noble in her ancestry, or else she wouldn’t have noble powers. Eva denies this.
Succeed
Lucifer and team break into underground server banks of central Noble stronghold on Earth. Lucifer implants a virus that will allow them to remotely control the AI fleet. 
After fighting into the underground, they barricade themselves into the server room. Eva and Adam, still estranged, notice a machine labelled Bloodline Verification. Adam pricks his finger on it to give a blood sample, and it reads ‘no noble blood found’. Eva does the same and it shows on that her father is Tribune Aelius of the Earth fleet. She is shocked and sits down. Adam tells her that not all nobles are bad. They hug and make up. Eva deicides that she needs to go to space to meet him.
Once the virus has uploaded, they steal credits and plant a bomb to make it look like a terrorist act. Eva opens a portal and everyone walks through it, but closes it without walking through it herself. She then opens a portal to get to the next room, steals a uniform and runs out of the facility in the confusion.
Mission
Eva goes to the nearest space elevator, and since she is of noble blood is allowed into space. She makes it into space. She discovers nobles are more complex than caracitures, with some brutal and some caring about commoners. They are all quite removed from Earth and many simply do not care that much. 
Fail
Eva goes to the local space elevator, and buys a ticket into space. She is shocked at the price, but buys a ticket and verifies her nobility by pricking her finger on a Bloodline Verification machine. Ticket seller’s eyes widen and she treats her with deference, Miss Aelius.
She rides up, finds it hard to understand accent, mannerisms and culture of nobles.
She finds that prices in space to do anything is so high that she is essentially broke. She asks around and finds that the defence fleet is docked at the 3rd Equatorial ring which she can travel to, but she does not have money. She sits down dejected, thinking of giving up.
Fail
Eva sees another man buying a ticket at the desk. He is a high ranking noble person, from the looks of it, with many medals on his jacket. When it comes time to pay, he says he is over rank 220 so he does not need to pay. He sneers at the clerk and tells him he does not want a rank 183 asking for his money. The clerk apoloigies and gives him the ticket for free.
Eva thinks maybe she can do the same. She walks up to the counter and says, I’m rank 187 so I demand to get a free ticket as well. The clerk does not react well to this, saying that they are both some derogatory word for low class nobles. The clerk looks at her scowling and laughs bitterly, and says that’s not worth much around here. 
Succeed
She then pleads the clerk to let her go see her father.
After some conversation she slips who her father is. Tribune Aelius.
The clerk stops slurping his coffee mid-sentence, and doesn’t believe her.
He lets her prick her finger. 
The computer shows she is the daughter of Tribune Aelius. 
He is shocked and tells her it is an honor. He gives her a free ticket.
She smiles and thinks this could be useful, and also is very confused who this father of her’s is.
Fail
She gets to the base where the Earth defence fleet is docked. She is awed by giant ships with lightmass cannons the size of large buildings. 
She tries to see her father but is told that it is not possible to see the Tribune without an appointment. Do you have an appointment?
Fail
She uses her portals to sneak into the docked flagship, to try and find her father. This works well to get to the door of his office, but she sets off an alarm and is caught by guards.
She starts shouting her Aelius, it’s me, your daughter.
Succeed
Aelius opens the door and asks what the commotion is. 
He sees her and pales. He says he knows her and that the guards are strictly not to talk about this to anyone.
She finally manages to meet her father and they talk in her office.
Eva finds her father, who is Tribune of Earth’s defence fleet. Rest of fleet is away fighting war on Mars. He tells her that her mother was as prostitute in New Paradise, who had been executed for becoming pregenant with a nobleman. Eva’s father paid to have the baby moved to a synthetic womb before she was executed by lightfire. She stood defiantly as she was executed, head high.
Eva was put in an orphanage so she wouldn’t be killed. He says he is sorry, but that she needs to leave or they could both be executed if who she is was discovered.
As they are talking, Aelius gets a call. From bits of the conversation that Eva hear, the robotic fleet.. That’s impossible.. Attacked the housing rings?
Lucifer has brought the plan ahead of schedule, and is attacking noble civilians. Eva feels sick to the stomach. It forces her to remember the carnage in her childhood that the purification squads inflicted on her friends. She does not wish that on anyone. 
The room shakes and the dockyards and under attack from AI ships.
Act 3
Eva grudgingly trusts and joins forces with her father to stop Lucifer. She gets into contact with Adam on the Earth, who says that Lucifer is out of control and has programmed the AI fleet to kill all nobles that it detects. The goal is to stop him, violence and hate just lead to more of the same. Eva breaks the cycle, bringing people together and restoring balance. She does this by overcoming her own inability to trust others as well.
Fail
The flagship undocks and starts to engage the AI ships, lightmass cannons firing. They do damage, but the AI fleet is much more advanced than the outdated defence fleet. The modern main fleet is fighting a war at Mars. 
Aelius tells Eva that she has to leave the ship, as it is too dangerous. He gives her a suit and keycard, telling her to take the elevator to the hanger and escape using a shuttle.
She gets to the hanger the hanger has been damaged by enemy fire, with dead people and debris floating around in it, hard vaccum. She can’t get in with her flimsy flight suit.
Fail
Eva sees the shuttle free floating in the bay, no artificial gravity to hold it down. It is moving so it will be extremely difficult to portal into it safely. She uses a portal to 
Succeed
She gets into the ship and escapes the flagship, which is under attack. She manages to evade the AI ships by blending into the mass of ships trying to escape. She heads for her crew’s location on Earth.
Fail
She confronts Lucifer on Earth, telling him that simply slaughtering nobles will just lead to more violence. He tells her that they are getting what they deserve, after so long of opressing them. She rips something off her person, patch or something and throws it on the ground in front of him. She calls to the crew to join her instead of Lucifer.
Lucifer sneers at her, mocking her for wearing an earth defence force flight suit. He says she must be noble if she got into space, and calls her a traitor to the plebs. The team looks on in silence. 
No one steps forward to join her, except for Adam. He says he will follow her.
Lucifer says he will not let noble opressors like her, or blood traitors like Adam live. He points a gun at them. 
The mentor uses the last bit of his powers to stop Lucifer for a short amount of time. He tells them to run.
They run to the parked shuttle and escape. The rest of the team just stands and watches. As they are taking off, a gunshot is heard. The mentor has been killed.

Modify timeline so Eva has to steal a ship to escape to get away from invading the Earth HQ, after Adam steals the mothership / betrays the group, or maybe they are attacked and she is seperated from the group. What motivates Eve to go to her father?
She only goes to her father after she helps Adam get to the mothership. Maybe she only leaves because he starts to kill nobles indiscriminately and go on a rampage. Makes her feel sick to her stomach. Like jihaddi in that book, this could be initial reaction way before
And builds up over time. At the start of the book Eva feels sick and cold when large number of plebs are massacared. Does not want to see this happen to nobles, any human.y
Fail
Eva asks her father if they could access the Earth Noble HQ to upload another virus into the mothership stop Adam from being able to control the machines. The Noble HQ has a quantum link into the mothership, the only way to access it since it is a military vessel. 
Eva tells her father that she helped deliver the initial virus, so could do the same thing again to stop Adam.
Eva’s father opens a satellite feed to Noble HQ. They watch in horror as a lightmass bombardment melts the facility, from the broadsides of the machine mothership in orbit. Adam anticipated this as a strategy - which now rules out all external strategies for hacking into the mothership. They need to go there in person now.
Succeed
Adam is onboard the mothership of the thinking machine fleet, having partially merged his consciousness with the machine. His subconscious impulses are controlling the fleet, which is to kill as many nobles as possible. (he always had claimed to want to lift up the plebs) (the machines are not as intelligent as humans. Maybe like cunning wolves, running more on instinct than thinking. Could be the machine ‘wolf’ personality affects the human who controls them too, since machines were bred to be as agressive and dangerous as possible, since they are killing robots.)
Make Lucifer and Adam (love interest) the same character.
Eva, with the help of her father, attack the ship and Eva walks into the control room where Adam is hooked up to the machine.
Fail
Adam loves Eva, but hates nobles. Eva tells Adam that she is a noble, and he must choose between love and hate.
Adam first doesn’t believe that Eva could be a noble. She proves it by allowing him with his machine augmentation to look at her chip.
Fail
Adam tells her that all he wanted to do was create a better world for the plebs. Eve tells him that he has lost his way. Adam weeps and tells her that he cannot control his mind anymore, that his subconscious and machine consciousness have merged and is too strong for him to resist.
He looks at the carnage that he is causing, all the people that are being killed by the machines.
Adam says these people all deserve to die for what they did to the Plebs. Wiping out continents worth of people with their experiments to improve human genetic stock. Eve says maybe they do deserve to die, but killing them is just going to spiral the situation downwards. Violence just leads to more violence.
Adam gets angry and tells her that she is soft, and doesn’t have the stomach to do what needs to be done. The neural link flickers, as strong emotions will interfere with the neural connection.
Tears fall down Eve’s face, and she whispers, "Maybe not everyone can be saved."
Succeed
She points the gun at her own head. She tells Adam that she can sever the neural link between him and the machine by causing him to feel an extreme emotion. He stares at her and tells her, "Don’t.. Please."
She tells him this is the only way. She tells him love is the most powerful force in the universe, and that love conquers all. It is the love between them that is in the end what matters. 
She says, "I love you."
Bang. 
The machine ships hung silently in the air, a second before they had been rampaging through the space docks.
Adam sat in the control room, machines and control panels lifeless around him. The neural link sits dead in the center of the room.
Eva’s father is carrying the body of Eva out of the machine mothership.
Eva’s father is making a speech at the end. It was a plebian that made the sacrifice to save us all. We care too much about what we are and not enough about what we could be. I look foward to the day where we can all be brothers and sisters again, united by a love for a common purpose, instead of judging each other based on a number. 
He ends the speech by saying, "This plebian.. Was my daughter."
The senate immediate erupts in whispering and talking. "You are under arrest." a man shouts. He is led out of the senate, shoulders back and head held high, with the faint trace of a smile on his face.


They create an alternate plan, that requires coordination between all of them and they have to trust each other. Adam, Eve and father join forces. The flagship flies down towards the Earth, while the shuttle flies up. They meet in the middle, and board the flagship. 
They need a plan that the AI has not yet predicted. What is something that an AI would not be able to understand?
The AI has been given simple orders to wipe out Nobles. It is systematically targeting the highest nobles first, to try and wipe out out command structure. 
They create a virus to hack into Lucifer’s biochip, to make him the highest ranking noble in the solar system. They suspect that this will cause the machines to attack him instead.
Ending - heirarchies should not be completely flattened or remain tyrranical. They need to be given to the individual so the competent can succeed in them successfully. To be fair.

Eva sacrifices herself to save humanity, maybe to teleport them to the throne room of the AI ship where Lucifer has merged his mind with the machine’s. Adam fights the machine god and sacrifices himself to destroy it, relinquishing the machine slaves from it’s central control. This emancipates the AI underclass of Earth, giving them freedom and self consciousness. 
Slaves - Robots incapable of reproduction, built in the image of humans. Copy of a human consciousness. Nobles do not have to work since they get slaves to work for them.
Plebs - Majority of humans who live on Earth, who are looked down on as underclass by humans who live in space. Not allowed into space as their ‘number’ based on genetics is not high enough. 
Nobles - Humans who created these robots. Now fashion themselves as gods who live in space. Consider themselves the guardians of human genetics, and that they are fair since they will adopt plebs of high enough genetic potential.


With approval from the noble council, they agree to temporarily promote Lucifer to the highest ranking noble on earth, with the hopes the AI will target him.
They do so, and broadcast this to the AI. The AI immediately change course and target him. 
Lucifer is on the ground, and sees an impossibly bright light in the sky. He closes his eyes, as it get brighter and hotter. The raises his head, and is then hit with a lightmass beam that vaporizes his.
The next step is they reduce the rank of all nobles to plebs, which causes the AI to stop attacking. They insist this is a temporary measure, but run into roadblock political issues since everyone else is same rank as them now. 
End with reconciliation and starting to build trust between heaven and earth, noble and pleb. Father insists there is a natural order, but it needs to serve love in order to be stable. 
Ends with Eve and Adam embracing with a kiss. Maybe I’ve finally found a person that I can trust.
