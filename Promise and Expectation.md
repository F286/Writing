# Promise and Expectation

### Perception as a series of abstractions
As humans we perceive reality through a series of abstractions that build on one another, in the same way as the layers of a convolutional neural network. Artificial neural networks have been able to perceive objects and achieve basic goals, but it has been a challenge to have them understand meaning in a complex way. This is potentially because we train them on large amounts of static input and output data, but do not give them a way to interact and create a feedback loop with an external reality. Embodiment is crucial as it creates the tension between focusing on acting and noticing the specific case.

### Abstract and Specific, *A* and *The*
The fact that we have a body makes it necessary for us to act in the present. We take billions of points of sense data and abstract them into a representation that is meaningful to us - that is it tells us what to do. When we see a cup, it tells us to pick it up. When we see a wolf, it tells us to run away. To act makes it necessary to collapse possibility into an actual action - the wolf chases me to the cliff by the sea, to jump or not to jump?
This creates a fundamental tension, where the series of abstractions that culminate with physical action in the world also necessarily blind us to specific details. “The wolf chasing me sure is scary. But hmm, what’s that metal flashing on its neck? Is this the neighbour’s dog?” 
The necessity to focus on acting is balanced by the ability to notice what happens in reality. 

### The Story we Tell Ourselves
Our perception is structured in a way that’s rooted in physical action in reality. To put one foot in front of the other is to expect to move forward. Stories are a form of our implicit perceptual structure, so they have a close relationship with perception. Stories can reorder a person’s perception so the world they see is radically altered, such as with religious conversion. 
As humans we believe implicit stories, that we use as a map to know where we are in our internal world. The story also implicitly implies what you should pay attention to, therefore value, by what it chooses to point out. A story is in a sense a promise, it creates what you expect - a prediction of the future.
So pay attention the story you tell yourself, as it creates the world you live in.
Phases are a simplified story map, where the implicit promise is one phase will lead to another, and everyone agrees that they are in the same phase, in other words location.

### When you don’t know where you are
As humans we do not only exist as individuals, but also as groups. When we do not share a story with another person, we cannot predict their actions. This causes us to become stressed when interacting with them, as we do not know how they will react. Without a map that works we do not know where we are. Our body prepares for everything, which while useful when running from a wolf causes stress and physiological damage long term. 

### A Shared Game
To co-exist with others we need to adopt a shared story, which molds our perception and action into predictable patterns. In a sense we are all playing a game together, and games have rules both written and unwritten. (Explicit and implicit) We become uncomfortable when it looks like a person does not understand the rules, or they refuse to follow the rules, since we can no longer constrain the variability in their behavior. Too much variability is random and terrifying, while too little variability is boring and dead. Just the right abound of variability is interesting and fun, and keeps our attention.

### Uncharted worlds
We are able to create or discover new stories, in a sense creating new worlds that we can live in. The change in our perceptual world can change reality, then loop back and lead to a positive or negative snowball effect. Truthful speech is an example of a process which generates a story map that a group of people can agree on and live with.
