# Be Willing to Change

Issues can arise when you are not willing to change. There is a positive side to this, as it can be effective to maintain the status quo when a system is working. However, when the environment changes, it is important to be willing to abandon processes that are no longer effective, and create new ones that are effective.

A common issue is when transitioning to a new coding environment, team members often maintain the coding style and conventions from the previous environment. This is part inertia and part stubborn refusal to embrace a new way of doing things.

Often the case is that a team member is attached to a specific way of doing things. Normal work tasks are no problem, but it becomes very difficult to improve the work processes. Over time as unresolved issues in the workflow stack on top of each other, and it becomes exponentially harder to add new features and more and more time is spent doing trivial bug fixes.

If about 70% of your time is spent on bug fixes, it could be possible that you are trapped in a low level fix-as-fail (reactionary bug fix) loop. You can break out of this loop by moving up to a prevention loop (prevent the bugs from happening), then a fix-the-root-cause loop (fix the root issues that are generating the bugs) then finally to an anticipation loop (anticipate what is going to happen and setup processes to avoid bugs before they occur). 

#### Q. Maybe you are not willing to change to the existing system?

Just ask each person on the team if they think there are any issues with being able to improve the work processes.

#### Q. You can't place all the problems at the feet of React.

That is correct, React is not the root cause of the problem. React is a work process that was effective in the Javascript version, but is no longer effective in the Unity version. The issue is that the work processes cannot be updated.

Yes that is correct, React isn't the root cause of the problem. This is an example of a work process that was effective in the previous Javascript version of the app, but unfortunately is no longer effective in Unity.

About 70% of our time is spent on bug fixes, but we do not focus on fixing the issues that are causing the bugs. We end up trapped at a low level reactionary loop, and can not go on the offensive and fix the root causes, and eventually get to the anticipate future problems loop.



Most of our time is currently spent doing bug fixes, 


About 80% of time is spent doing bug fixes, 

One potential solution is to become attached to being willing to change, instead of a specific way of doing things.

We've done it before, and it has worked.
