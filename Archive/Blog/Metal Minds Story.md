# Metal Minds

## Chapter 1

*As you see the world through my eyes, understand that there was a justice to what I did. The end of one life is simply the beginning of another.*

Light poured into the chamber. 

Elund looked over the terminal, and checked the wires connecting to a bubbling tank a few meters away. A grey mass poked out, with hundreds of wires attached at various points. Underneath was it's unfortunate owner, who had been enjoying tasty bananas in the jungle canopy just a few hours earlier.

Elund walked over to the tank, and shuddered slightly as he reached his hand inside and attached the final lead to the warm pulsating mass.

This led to a second tank containing a metal that appeared to be mercury. It was roughly the size of two fists, constantly flowing over itself. A metal mind. One this large would be worth more than his life.

He heard a click and the door opened behind him.

"About time we got on with this then?" Anon said in his upper class cadence, stepping over patches of fur on the floor.

"There isn't much time left," Elund said, his eyes flashing with discomfort. "The brain will only last a few more minutes, the echo state is already degrading."

"Echo state?" Anon asked, eyebrows raising slightly.

"How the electricity echoes in the brain," Elund quickly replied, "Like shouting in a big room, but the sound keeps bouncing around."

"I'm not quite sure if I follow," Anon replied, frowning slightly. "That's why I keep you around Elund. We will continue then?"

Elund walked to the terminal and pressed the button. The large, red button. The tank began to bubble vigorously. 

*I really don't want to cut up any more monkeys,* he thought, *this better work.*

The screen displayed two brains. The animal mind, the monkey, was alive with regular brain activity. The metal mind, located inside the terminal, was inert and dead.

"I've begun the upload," Elund said nervously. "It shouldn't take more than a minute."

They both stared at the tank, bubbles increasing. The wires flowed a cool blue color, transferring the electrical patterns of the brain to the terminal.

Elund looked over at the terminal and breathed a sigh of relief, the upload was progressing well. The metal mind was beginning to mirror the patterns of the other. It almost looked like things were going well.

Then massive electrical ripples exploded in the monkey's brain. Elund paled, this could only mean one thing. *Catastrophic desynchronization.*

*The mind is rejecting the transplant,* Elund thought. This was bad, very bad.

"Woah! We're going to kill the monkey!" Elund panicked, pointing at the terminal.

"It's just a monkey," Anon said coolly, "Continue the upload."

Beads of sweat prickled at Elund's forehead. *Three years of work. We wouldn't torture humans like this, definitely not? Not sure if I want to find out.*

An alarm sounded from the terminal. Elund's eyes widened as electricity arced from the metal mind to bits of metal on the floor. He coughed as the smell of ozone and burnt fur filled the room.

Elund smashed the big red button on the terminal, stopping the upload.

"It's incomplete," Elund blurted. The bubbles in the tank abruptly stopped. "But it should be enough to read the markers."

"Excellent," Anon said, snapping his gloves off. "We will need to keep this quiet. If the Canton finds out, well, we might end up like this monkey. You can keep it safe?"

"I'll do it," Elund nodded. "My crew's safehouse in the slums, no one will look there."

Anon nodded, walking to the door. "I will be going then," Anon said. "Good luck, I suspect you will need it."

Elund looked down at the tank, the monkey no longer breathing. "Sorry about that," he whispered. 

Sometimes sacrifices had to be made.

## Chapter 2
*Our genetics were the blueprint to our power, why this information was contained I do not know, there is much we do not understand. We were not evil men, simply determined.*

Elund grimaced as he stepped outside, despite the darkness he could see his breath, cold mist curling at his feet. The city of Antioch surrounded him, vast slums occasionally puncutated by curving gleaming spires, shining a brilliant golden light.

Elund quickly walked down the steps, metal mind heavy in the pocket of his trench coat. Moonlight glistened on the slick stone steps, cobblestone street deserted in front of him.

Elund arrived at the safehouse about half an hour later, hanging his jacket as he walked inside.

"I told you not to do that," a femenine voice said from behind him.

Elund startled, turning around quickly. "Haven! Not to do, what?"

"Wear your shoes inside, dummy," Haven said, eyebrow raised. She had black hair, with steely brown eyes contrasting her cuter, softer face.

Elund grinned, "Not my fault that bothers you."

Haven rolled her eyes, then walked over touching his jacket pocket. "Now what is this?" she said, expression inquisitive.

"Oh just something from work," Elund said, "Not a big deal."

"Oh well now I'm sure you're hiding something." Haven said, staring at his jacket pocket. "I can see right through you."




"You mean that literally, right?" Elund said, scratching the back of his neck. "Well, you have promise not to tell anyone."

"I promise," Haven said, face smiling a little too much.

"Well I guess it's ok," Elund sighed, opening his jacket pocket and taking the metal mind out.

"Oh my god!" Haven said, looking at the metal mind. "These are worth millions!"

"This," Elund said slowly, "Is the mind of the dear monkey that I sent you pictures earlier."

Haven frowned, "You can't expect me to believe that you have a metal mind, do you?"



"We can't be careless," she snapped, "The Canton picks up on these sort of things, if,"

"Don't worry ,"

 Not many people were about at this hour, but a voice in his head told

Elund took off in a brisk walk towards the safehouse, 


The steel mind weighed heavily in his pocket. , 
He had orders to deliver the metal mind to the Steel Ministry building, he would have to 
He had orders to deliver the metal mind to a drop-off point in the slums. 

Elund closed his eyes, falling into a deep state of calm. As he opened them, there was complete silence. As he walked down the steps, people appeared frozen, and cars moved in slow motion on the street. 

He was a stabilizer, he could speed up time for himself

powers related to meditation? so can not use power when angry, or have to control extremely well.

""

most people cannot get implants since their bodies will immediately reject them. those who do, most will only accept a small amount. very few people, such as Anon can replace up to half their brain with 'metal', which makes them extremely powerful.

the 'metal' is living however, and will slowly grow to replace the entire brain. this is generally known to be fatal, as the body will reject it.

Lord ruler? provides something to stop this growth, how he controls his subjects for his religion.

Elund specificly 


Anon stepped out behind him, pocketing the metal mind from earlier. It could be quite dangerous walking with anything valuable through the slums. 
He quickly stuffed the metal mind that contained the monkey into his trenchcoat's pocket. 

Anon walked ahead, 

"Like tufts of grass growing from dirt," Anon said idly, motioning at the spires in the distance.

"We were like them once, " Elund said, brow furrowing slightly.

"Bah. They are simply weak. "


"You were human once too, Anon," Elund said, brow furrowing slightly. ""


Elund could see his breath as he stepped outside, the bitter cold numbing his face. The city of Antium spawled out in front of him, glittering curved skyscrapers poking out from vast slums, like tufts of grass growing from the surrounding dirt. 


Elund could see his breath as he stepped outside, face prickling from the bitter cold. The city of Antium sprawled as far as he could see,
