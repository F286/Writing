# Zoom Out

###### True excellence is not winning 100 battles, it is to win without having to fight.

Better than solving a problem well is to avoid it in the first place. If there is friction between team members on a trivial issue, it can be useful to bring the conversation out of the weeds to a higher, more zoomed out level. Usually common ground can be found by zooming out. For example, team members may disagree on what type of Singleton should be used. But, if we zoom out we can all agree that good code structure is important, and have a productive conversation about how we have done it in the past.

By changing the framing of the conversation, we may be able to avoid the trivial issue, which is usually motivated by ideology, and instead find a good goal for the conversation and focus on that instead.

# Take a Step Back

Many issues within teams can be avoided by taking a look at the processes that are causing issues instead of the issues themselves. Directly solving an issue is great, but fixing the process so this sort of issue never happens again is even better. For example, there may be an issue where team members are working in the same area and they end up stepping on each others' toes. You may have to manually intervene and smooth things over with both of them. On the other hand, you could modify the process in which work is assigned so they mostly work in separate areas and as a consequence don't step on each others' toes.

A collection of processes can be viewed as a system. The environment that the team is embedded in is made up of systems, some carefully thought out, some iteratively evolved over time, and some haphazardly thrown together.

The systems a person is embedded in can radically alter both their categorical and value structures. For example, a person living in a Communist country works but does not get paid, perhaps .

We pretend to work, they pretend to pay us.

A team's system is made up of processes that are used for every day tasks (such as choosing what ticket to do in the morning) as well as more subtle structural things such as reinforcing structural categories.

# A Systemic Approach

 A team is made up of many systems working together and at odds with one another.
