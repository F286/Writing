# Above the Horizon - Execute

What you see is not real.

Marie stared into the mist, almost seeing a form, the feeling of almost remembering a word on the tip of her tongue. The control room spread around her, sleek white walls with padded cushions at regular intervals. She felt something in her hand and looked down, it was a remote with a single large button. She turned it over and saw symbols, she was afraid for an instant but as she looked at them she understood. Pressing this button would release what was contained in the mist. This terrified her. But she also knew that this is what she must do. She drew her thumb closer to the button, eyes wide staring into the curling and transforming mist. Almost.. then two eyes opened in the mist, staring back.

Marie woke with a start, covered in sweat. She pushed her long dark hair off of her face, ungluing her eyelids with her fingers. Had she been.. crying? She cradled her head in her hands as she sat up, discarded pizza boxes and stim needles strewn across the floor. Marie opened her journal and tried to remember, she wrote, “Day 73. White room with mist. Saw eyes this time, they stared back.” This sent a shiver up her spine. 

She snapped the journal shut then stood up, groaning. She pushed aside the pizza cartons on the floor, careful to avoid jabbing her foot on needles, and cleared a space. She carefully unfurled a beautiful ornate rug, not taller than herself, and gently placed it on the floor. She wiped her face, hands and feet with alcohol wipes, then knelt on the rug in silence.

“Allfather, let us remember thy path, lend us thy sight to see it, and give us thy courage to walk it,” Marie whispered.
She knelt down and touched her forehead to the ground.






Eva reverently chewed the last piece of bread she had taken from her coat pocket. The shouts of food stall vendors in the street below mixed with the mechanical hum of a police aircar, it’s search light sweeping over her and the surrounding buildings. 
Her stomach rumbled as she climbed her thin arms up the black metal escape ladder of the building, it’s steps slick with the near constant rain of New Paradise. Eva wiped the rain from her face, shivering from the cold. She peered over the short brick wall of the roof, the bright lights of the vendor contrasted with the darkness of the night sky. A roundish man with red cheeks stuck his fingers into the machine he stood beside, pulling out an apple and handed it to a woman waiting in line. Eva’s felt a deep pang in her stomach. 
Eva gingerly grabbed onto a rusty drain pipe going down the side of the building. She looked down briefly and felt a momentary rush of vertigo. She carefully lowered herself down using slippery footholds until she got to the ground. Tent pegs were hammered directly into the muck the ground had become, tanks of petrol were stacked behind the small tent.
"Step right up, anything you want. An apple? Or maybe an orange?"
The woman holding the apple handed it to her son, and he took a bite. His eyes crinkled in delight as he said, "Wow!"
Eva crept to the side of the tent, keeping her head low. She could see clearly see the machine, a rugged cube shaped piece of metal with several hoses running backwards into the petrol tanks. Inside it bursts of light illuminated the bottom half of an apple slowly rotating inside it. Eva’s eyes widened as the saw the apple was rapidly growing taller, within a few seconds becoming a full size apple.
The man pulled the apple out and handed it to the next customer in line, who tapped their wrist against a screen making a beeping sound.
Eva looked at her own wrist, which was smooth with light blue veins where the tracker should have been.
The little boy eating the apple pointed in Eva’s direction, and tugged on his mom’s jacket. "What is it now?" the mother asked.
Eva felt a jolt of adrenaline, pulling back behind the edge of the tent. They must have seen her. She peered back out slowly, the boy and mother were walking in Eva’s direction, the mother with a worried expression on her face.
"Go, Eva. You gotta go," she whispered to herself.
She took one last peek. An apple sat in the machine, it’s juicy skin covered in droplets reflecting the chaotic lights of the night market.
She dashed towards the machine, past the mother who pulled her boy close with a gasp. The round man looked at her bug-eyed, and raised a hand to stop her. Eva ducked and shot out her arm, touching the cool skin of the apple. She bolted towards the crowd, angry voices calling out behind her.
Eva’s feet were sliding under her as she hurtled into the crowd. She dodged through arms and legs, on the brink of disaster. Through the gaps in people as she ran she spied the black metal escape ladder of a building, only starting on the second floor. She burst out of the crowd.
At that moment her world went white. As she raised her arm to cover her eyes, they exploded in blinding pain.
I can’t see, Eva thought. 
She heard the hum of a aircar above her, and the clinking sounds as ziplines were deployed.
She could hear the thudding of several people landing around her.
She felt a blow crash into the back of her head, ears ringing as she fell into the muck. She gasped, tears ran down her cheeks as she tilted her head upwards towards the pouring rain.
"Hand out palm up, pleb," barked an order. 
She raised her hand, revealing her smooth wrist. The world felt like it was falling around her.
"This one’s got no tracker," laughed a male voice. "Filthy illegal."
"Hold her up so I can scan her," another female voice cut in.
Eva felt a hand on her shoulder as a whirring field moved across her body. She could feel her skin prickling and the hairs stand up as it moved up and down across her body.
She could hear the officers talking in hushed voices, the conversation becoming heated.
"..no way that’s the case.."
"..that thing is broken.."
"Just get her into the car," the female voice cut in.
Eva heard the whirring sound of the aircar getting louder and she was led toward it. She heard a clicking noise as a something bit into her wrists. As she tried to move her hands apart a sharp plastic bit painfully into her hands. Tears welled in her eyes. Handcuffs, she thought.
She was pushed into the aircar, and could feel the acceleration as it took off. It banked hard left and started to pick up speed. She could hear a faint whine of the landing struts being pulled into the aircar.
We’re going outside the city, Eva thought.
Eva was tired to the bone, and now had a splitting headache. She felt the fatigue pull at her. Down, down, it seemed to say.
She felt in her jacket and carefully took out the apple.
She bit into it and chewed rapidly. The driver glanced over his shoulder and chuckled. She finished the entire thing in less than a minute.
The last thing she remembered before falling into a deep sleep was the sound of rain pounding on the car.

Eva awoke in a small dormitory with cheap plastic beds, morning light streaming onto her face through a small window with steel bars on it. Eva rubbed her tender eyes, they felt like they had sand in them, but atleast she could see again.
Eva stood up and was shocked at how soft the floor was, a soft fuzzy material underneath her feet. This is how patricians must live, she mused. Why would they treat me so well?
She heard a knocking sound, and turned her head to see the door swinging open. A woman smartly dressed in suit walked in, wearing horn-rimmed glasses that made her look older than her age, tightly gripping a briefcase.
"Good morning. Please sit down, plebian," she said formally, motioning to the desk and two chairs in the center of the room. She had a slight accent, a clipped musical sound to her voice.
Eva walked over and sat down in the chair, avoiding looking directly at her.
"I suppose you must be wondering why I am here?" the woman asked, 
Eva walked over and sat in the chair, avoiding eye contact.
"My name is Julia," the woman said, outstretching her hand, "of House Faunus"
Eva stuck her hand out, feeling awkward. Julia clasped her hand, putting her left hand over it as well. Julia opened her briefcase and took out a file.
"I am here to review your case. You were caught stealing in the Forum, no?" the woman asked.
Eva stared at the floor, and didn’t react.
"And it says here you resisted arrest?" the woman asked.
Eva snorted, "Hardly. Just gave your blue bloods a little workout."
Julia’s eyes narrowed. "What’s your tracking code?" she said, pulling a small flat scaner out of her briefcase.
Eva grimaced, holding up her right hand. In plain view Julia could see her wrist, smooth as her other wrist where the tracker should have been.
Julia frowned, taking her wrist and examining it. "That’s strange. You weren’t tracked when you were born?"
"Doesn’t look like it," Eve said nonchalantly. "Don’t know you you patricians are so concerned with these anyways."
"You know as well as anyone," Julia scowled. "We use these to monitor the Earth’s population for genetic defects."
Eva stared at the woman. There’s something she isn’t telling me, Eve thought.
"Well, just to set expectations, I will have to file a request to get you a tracker, that may take time," Julia said clasping her hands together.
Fine by me, Eve thought. Not like patricians ask for permission anyways.
"Thank you, Julia of house Fanus." Eva said respectfully.
"And to you, plebian Eva," Julia said, nodding.
"Let me help you with your briefcase," Eva said, standing up, grabbing the corner accidently knocking it onto the floor.
"Look what you done, girl!" Julia said, stooping on her knees picking up her things.
"I’m so sorry miss!" Eve said, joining Julia on the floor and helping her.
"Did your parents not teach you finesse?" Julia said, face reddening.
Eve spied Julia’s keycard sticking out of her pocket, and expertly palmed it and slipped it into her sleeve.
"I’m sorry miss," Julia said, making a show of bumbling to help her.
Snap. Julia’s briefcase was shut. Julia huffed and stood up, leaving the room.
Eva let out a breath and grinned, feeling the hard plastic of the keycard against her arm.
Eva walked over to the bed and stood on it, tip-toes. She could barely see over the windowsill, but could just make out snow covered mountains outside. In the valley below the sparkling lights of New Paradise stretched into the distance.
Eva walked to the door and put on slippers, determined to explore wherever she was. She walked down a hallway and heard the sound of voices in a nearby room. She peered inside, and saw several people inside, chatting and laughing in front of a cracking fireplace. 
Absolutely terrifying, she thought, feeling slightly nauseous.
She braced herself and walked into the room, glancing at the people there.
"You must be the girl they brought in last night," said a petite woman with a small sharp nose and long curly black hair. Eva could hear a slight lisp to her speech. "It’s a shame these rooms are so.. drab," she said, nose wrinkling slightly.
Eva looked at her with a puzzled expression. "I thought it was quite nice," she said.
Marie raised her eyebrows slightly, and gestured towards the others. "You should meet the rest of the crew. This is Adam," she said. 
Adam flashed Eva a smile and cocked his head slightly, stretching out his hand. She could see the fireplace reflecting in his blue-green eyes, looking at her intensely. "Greetings, companya. We are plebians as well, you are among friends." He took her hand lightly and kissed it.
Eva inhaled sharply and felt her cheeks warm. She noticed she was embarassed, an emotion she had not felt in a long time. She looked to Maria who rolled her eyes.
"We got caught sneaking into Central. That’s why we’re here," Adam grinned.
"What is this place?" Eve asked, trying to stand up straighter. 
"We’re not quite sure yet. This complex seems to be located on a mountain, and there’s a harbor in the valley as well. We’ve seen some ships visit flying old world flags as well," Adam said, frowning slightly.
"So this is a prison?" Eva asked.
"In a sense, maybe," Adam said quietly, "some sort of holding facility until they can legally exile us."
Eva was silent, mulling over what Adam’s words. Why would they exile plebs instead of just execute us? They’ve had no problem doing that before, Ela thought.
"Why would they go to the effort to exile us?" Eva asked. Her tone implied the alternative.
"The patricians have oppressed us for generations, this doesn’t change anything. They pretend to have a justice system but it’s just an excuse for their power," Adam said bitterly.
Eva nodded slowly. Growing up on the streets she had heard whispers of brutal purification squads arresting plebians who would never be seen again.
"You’re just gonna let them exile you?" Eva asked drawing closer.
Adam looked around, making sure there were no handlers in the room. He drew close and whispered in her ear conspiratorially, "This facility goes on lockdown after 10 pm. But we’ve tunnelled a virus into their system," he nodded to Maria, who put her hand on the back of her neck.
"Just a trick, really. Managed to hack in through the smart lights in the room. Anyways, all the doors will unlock for a few seconds at 12:48 pm," Maria said.
"Will you join us?" Adam asked.
Eva looked at her feet, she saw her orphanage burning in her mind. "Don’t trust anyone," the voice said.
"I.. can’t," Eva stammered.
Adam looked disappointed but nodded. "You’re from the streets, I get it. Trust takes time." Adam forced a smile.
"Listen, if you get out of here, let me know if you want to meet the team. We could use someone with your skillset, " Adam said.
He held out his hand to shave Eva’s, which she took awkwardly.
"Thanks," Eva said awkwardly, then noticed he had handed her a piece of paper. She shoved it in her pocket without thinking about it.
Eva smiled and nodded at Adam, and walked out of the room.
Damnit, Eva thought, that wasn’t very smooth.
Would it even be possible to escape a facility like this? Eva thought, the beginnings of a plan swirling in her mind.

Eva lay in her bed, unable to sleep. She glanced over at the clock. It read 12:45.
Three minutes until the door unlocks, she thought.
You’ve been running your whole life, Eva. Is that what you want to keep doing? she asked herself.
Tick. Tock.
Two more minutes.
Eva imaged a guard shouting, "Halt!" before whipping out his gun and Crack! What would it feel like to get shot? It must hurt, but no one thinks of that.
What am I gonna do? I don’t have a chip? Where could I get one?
Eva racked her brain.
One more minute.
It was now or never. She wouldn’t get a better chance than this to escape whatever this prison was.
The keycard. I can use it to get into the medical bay, maybe then..
Ten seconds.
Click.
Eva pushed softly on the door, it smoothly swinging open without a sound. She looked back at her room, the bed and table faintly illuminated by moonlight.
Eva crept along the hallway, barely daring to breathe. If she got caught, things would not end well.
Click.
The door clicked shut behind her.
Eve felt a twinge of fear run down her spine. No turning back now, she thought.
She crept until she found a door that led to a staircase that let upwards. If this complex had a medical bay it would be on the top floor, as close as possible to aircar access.
As she climbed to the top floor she could see the faint outline of the intertwined snake symbol that marked a medical bay.
"Yes!" Eva whispered under her breath.
She over her shoulder before pulling out the keycard and tapping it against the glass door.
The door smoothly opened horizontally, and Eva crept in, keeping her head down.
She was in a spacious semi-circular room that had various devices and beds around the perimeter of the room.
Eva walked up to the nearest machine, straining her eyes in the dim light. It hummed softly, a soft yellow light glowing within. A flat bedlike surface was covered by a cynlindrical pane of glass. It looked just large enough for a person to fit inside.
Eva tenatively rapped her knuckles on the glass. Tic, tic tic. 
Nothing happened. 
Eva crept around the machine, seeing a small touch screen on the front of the unit. 
Eva tapped the screen, unsure of what to expect.
The unit whirred to life, light in side turning to a light blue. 
"Please provide identification," said a robotic voice.
Eve pressed her hand against the reader.
"No tracker recognized. Please provide override," said the not quite human voice.
How can I override this? Eva thought, resting her head on her hand.
The keycard! Eva realized. 
She fumbled into her sleeve and pulled out the card she had taken from Julia. She carefully held it against the reader, and realized she was holding her breath.
"Identity confirmed, Julia of House Fanus. What services do you require?"
Eva’s mind raced, the memories of all the close misses on the streets tugging at her thoughts. How do I get out of this?
"I need you to implant a tracker chip into this plebian," Eve blurted out.
There was a slight pause. "Understood. Please have the plebian remove clothing and lie on the omni-table." The glass covering on the machine silently rotated open.
Eva looked over her shoulder and hesitated only slightly. She removed her clothes, the night air cold on her skin. She pulled herself onto the table, suprised at it’s warmth and sponginess.
"Cover now closing. Please keep your arms at your sides and remain relaxed. Place your palms upwards and do not make any sudden movements." The voice said, the glass cover rotating shut with a click.
Eve squeezed her eyes shut and pointed her palms upwards. She could hear whirring sounds around her, with different colors of flashes of light leaking into her eyes. The hairs on the back of her neck pricked up when she felt her hands being clamped to the bed with straps.
Eva cried out in pain. She felt a deep stabbing pain just under her right wrist. The tracker, she thought. Tears were flowing down her cheeks. She then felt a warm pressure being applied to her wrist, along with the sound of foam spraying.
The straps seemed to loosen, and the smell of anastetic filled the small chamber.
"Tracker implant complete. Record has been logged to the central database. Cover now opening."
The cover rotated open, and Eva let out a breath she hadn’t realized she had been holding. Her wrist throbbed with a dull deep pain.
Eva rotated and sat, dangling her feet off the edge of the bed.
The machine chirped and hummed. "Citizen identified," the robotic voice spoke. "Eva Actius, Plebian First Class."
A cold prickling feeling spread from the nape of Eva’s neck.
Eva flicker her gaze towards her wrist, and could see a purple band growing from the tracker around her wrist like a noose.
"Identify me, robot," Eva snapped.
"Eva of House Actius, daughter of [redacted] member of Legion military."
Eva looked down at her wrist, and could see a purple band like a tattoo growing from the tracker like a noose.
A cold sweat spread through the nape of Eva’s neck
The machine chirped and hummed. "Fixing error with previous classification. The patient," the machine paused for a second. "Eva, was referred to as plebian. Incorrect. Genetic potential indicates she is," the machine paused again, "Patrician."
A deep queasy feeling gripped Eva’s stomach. A boy on her block had his tracker recognize him as a patrician. She could still remember his screams when the other boys found out and threw him off the edge of the apartment complex into the undercity below.
This must be a mistake, Julia thought. I used Julia’s keycard, the machine must think I’m her.
"Confirm staus of Eva," Eva told the machine.
"Invidiual sitting on the omni-bed is Eva of House Actius."
Eva felt cold. 

She remembered hearing stories of a boy on her block being recognized 
The kids at the orphange had told stories of patri
"Previous classification inaccurate. Patient was referred to as plebian. Bloodline and mental acuity places her at rank 193, patrician."
What? Eva thought, This machine must have me confused for Julia.
"That’s impossible," Eva said. "You must have me with Julia."
"Keycard holder is Julia of House Fanus is rank 161, lesser patrician."
Eva leaned back, stunned. 
She has always hated the patricians. They had killed her friends. They had chased and hunted her on the streets. How?
A siren started to whine in the distance. Oh no, Eva thought.
Someone has found me out. Or Adam and his crew. Time to go.
Eva hopped down from the table and put her clothes back on. She stared down at her wrist, which projected a faint hologram just above the skin. It was three purple bars of an inverted V shape. Greater patrician, she thought.
She quietly dashed out of the medical bay and crept up the stairs to the roof.
