## Chapter 1

*As you see the world through my eyes, understand that there was a justice to what I did. The end of one life is simply the beginning of another.*

Light poured into the chamber. 

Elend looked over the terminal, connected to a bubbling canister a few meters away. It contained a grey mass inside with hundreds of wires running out. The remains of a poor monkey, the original owner, sat lifeless on a table beside. 

Elund walked over to the tank, and shuddered slightly as he reached his hand inside and attached the final lead to the warm pulsating mass.

He heard a click and the door opened behind him.

"About time we got on with this then?" Anon said, stepping over bits of monkey on the floor.

"There isn't much time left," Elund said, his eyes flashing with discomfort. "The brain will only last a few minutes, the echo state is already degrading."

"Echo state?" Anon asked, eyebrows raising slightly.

"How the electricity echoes in the brain," Elund replied quickly, "Think of it as shouting at a wall, but the sound keeps bouncing around."

"I'm not quite sure if I follow," Anon said, eyes narrowing. "That's why I keep you around. We will continue then?"

Elund walked to the terminal and pressed a button. A large red button. The tank begun to began to bubble vigorously. 

*I really don't want to cut up any more monkeys,* he thought, *this better work.*

The screen showed two brains, the one in the tank and a second virtual one, recreated from a scan of the original. The first one was clearly alive, with electricity buzzing around. However, the second one was inert, with minimal activity.

"Echo state synchronization has begun," Elund said, "if it works, it will take 12 heartbeats."

They both stared at the tank, bubbling away. The wires pulsated a cool blue color, absorbing the electrical activity and transfering it to the terminal.

Elund looked over at the screen and froze. The two brains we no longer different, they mirrored each other, syncronized.

Then he paled, the massive electrical ripples between hemispheres could only mean one thing. The brain was experiencing massive seizures, and with it extreme pain.

"Boss! Look at the pain response! It's an animal but, should we terminate?" Elund said, pointing at the terminal.

"It's just a monkey." Anon said coolly, "Continue the upload."

Beads of sweat prickled at Elund's forehead. *Three years of work, all for this moment.* The terminal blared a warning, the mind was on the edge of breaking.

*We wouldn't torture a human like this, definitely not? Not sure if I want to find out.*

"Upload complete." Elund said. The bubbles in the tank abruptly stopped.

"Excellent." Amon said, snapping his gloves off. "Please send in to clean up this, mess we've created."

Elund looked down at the canister, now still. "Thank you," he whispered.


### Theme 
As technology and culture progesses we gain obvious benefits, but do we lose things without realizing it? (a la baby with the bathwater syndrome). eg religion is gone, have we lost anything because of that?

Most people are oblivious to differences in cultures, so past and future culture would have a lot of issues interacting, which could be interesting.

An AI would have a vastly different way to thinking (maybe?) even if based off a human, so could have different goals and cultural differences.

### Character
Elend will do anything to further research at start, lacks strong moral courage even though has some misgivings. By end he will learn to respect life ect.. 


### Outline
In a modern society alien first contract happens, however it turns out the aliens are actually humans from the future. (they insist they aren't *actually* from the future, that would be impossible, they are from a parallel version of what the universe *could've* been.

#### Start
MC wants to know more about the aliens. Most people hate the aliens, even though they don't hurt anyone. MC flaw is he lacks self control, will need to learn this by the end of the book.
