Cain walks through the city, he does not know where he is going, and does not know what his dream is. A homeless man grabs his leg, he reacts in anger. He feels bitter these people are allowed to sleep here. He walks into a social gathering, he talks to people but does not try to create a good atmosphere. Their mouths smile but eyes do not, he finds himself alone. He feels lonely. As he goes to sleep he is unhappy with the hand life has dealt him, and feels he would be happy if he could just get that one thing.

Abel walks through the city, he works hard to figure out how to get to his goal, he knows what his dream is. A homeless man grabs his leg, he is suprised but tries to smile at the man. He feels graditude that he is not hurt. He walks into a social gathering, he talks to people and tries to create a good atmosphere. He sees their eyes smile, and their feet point toward him. He feels loved. As he goes to sleep he is happy he has worked towards his goal, thinking of his dream he smiles.


A man walks through an unfamiliar city, he does not know his destination, he does not know his dream.

The Dream
What is your dream? (long term goals) Working towards your dream will give your life meaning - a reason to be alive.

Good Atmosphere
Create a good atmosphere, this will lead to open communication and is like ‘axle grease’ to oil the giant social machine.

Gratitude over Bitterness
Bitterness leads to resentment, which leads to to hatred, which leads to malevolence. This will lead to your life becoming indistinguishable from hell. Gratitude is the opposite emotion of bitterness, use this to combat it.

In the story of Cain vs Abel (Genesis) Cain and Abel can be thought of as the same person. When because of bitterness Cain ‘kills’ his ideal self, he says ‘my punishment is too great to bear’. The natural consequence of completely abandoning ones morals is a life indistinguishable from hell.

Religion
Religion has evolved in an evolutionary manner over tens of thousands of years, which can be confirmed by seeing how it evolved from Mesopotamian creation myths - Marduk kills the dragon and creates the world out of its pieces. Translation - man goes into Mother Nature (chaos), applies order and creates society out of it.

Egyptian creation myth - Ra sacrifices blah to save everyone. This is becoming more archetypical, which means the non-essential ideas are forgotten over time and only the core ideas remain.

Christian religion - God sacrifices his only son, even though they don’t deserve it, receiving nothing in return (ultimate sacrifice) to save humanity in the afterlife forever (ultimate good). This is now the ‘archetype’, notice how over time the traits become more and more ‘purified’, becoming the most strongest version of the idea possible.

It is important to respect religions and learn from them, as they have a pragmatic wisdom that has evolved into them.

Empathy
Try to understand other people’s point of view, and how what you say is interpreted by them.

Body Language
Use positive body language to create a good atmosphere, and learn to read cues from others such as direction feet point, the way the hands move, and facial cues. You must learn to read cues in context, and absolutely the other person cannot notice that you are observing them.

Write version for Japanese people to understand Western culture
Western society is similar to 体躯系文化 in Japan, and the way people feel is similar too. Try and act like that and you will do well.
