# Identify With the Hero

Your identity is what you identify with. What do you consider yourself to be? For example, you may put yourself in the 'object-oriented' programming camp. If someone says, "Hey, we are in a new environment. The standard style here is component-based so we should that instead." the visceral response is something like 'burn the heretic'. This can be counter productive though, if that is actually the correct thing to do.

After a considerable amount of painful learning and perhaps a failed project or two, you might learn that dogmatically keeping yourself in the 'object-oriented' camp is a bad idea. "Okay, maybe I could try component-based programming," you think. Then you learn it, and things improve. But what is causing this dogmatic behaviour, and how can it be avoided?

The issue is that you are naturally creating a category structure, then conflating your identity with a very specific piece of it. It becomes difficult to learn new things if that new thing could potentially destabilize a category that is part of your identity. What is the solution to this problem?

The solution is to transcend the category structure. Your identity must become the thing that is able to creatively and pragmatically update it's own category structure. This is represented archetypically as the hero. The hero sacrifices the part of himself that is outdated, which dies then is reborn. This is the voluntarily acceptance of the painful transformation process of updating one's own beliefs. Since your identity is now associated with the process that updates the value structure, and not the value structure itself it will no longer get in the way of learning.

This archetype is seen in movies as the hero. The hero has a deep flaw, which must be painfully overcome through meaningful sacrifice, only then can he achieve victory.

This is related to what the eye floating above the pyramid on the back of the American dollar bill represents. The eye represents logos, which is your attention and truthful speech, and shares the same root word with logic. The pyramid represents order, which is all the structures and hierarchies of our society. To transcend your category structure is to see the entire structure objectively, as well as where you fit into it. If you associate yourself with the eye instead of the pyramid, you will not have to fight everytime you update a category. You may even be able to creatively modify the category structures that we all swim in.

The issue is that you are creating a category structure, then putting yourself in a narrow spot within it. You can gradually increase the number of categories that you occupy, but this doesn't solve the fundumental problem. You can keep climbing to more and more

But this can be extended even further, this issue is that you are putting yourself into a category, into a box.

The solution is to transcend the category structure, to view it and yourself within it. With careful attention  to be able to view it from above and objectively.

But this can be extended even further. The issue is that you are putting yourself in a category, in a box. But as the Greek philosopher Heraclitus said, 'The only thing constant is change." Your environment will change, and perhaps considering yourself a musician in a few years will no longer be tenable. 

It can cause a lot of friction, and even failure, if you define yourself in a specific category. You will not want to change your category, and this failure to adapt can lead to disaster. A better solution is to identify with the constantly dying and resurrecting hero. The hero in a movie will have a flaw, and only by painfully overcoming this flaw (in a sense part of them dying and being reborn) will they be able to triumph. 

 and instead identify as the hero, that will actually affect how you perceive information. Just as category structures can affect how a team perceives information, in which category structure you place yourself has a strong effect on how you perceive the world. 

Identifying as the hero moves you outside the category structure, since you can objectively view the category structures and through careful attention choose where to place yourself in them, and how to modify them.

This is often repersented as an eye floating above a pyrmaid, as can be seen on the American dollar bill. The pyramid repersents the heirarchy (which the category structure is part of) and the eye repersents attention or logos (attention, articulated truth, logic). 





 But perhaps there is a way to avoid this problem, to make it easier to learn new things.  But does this have to happen every time you learn something? But is this a truly sustainable solution? Why do I care so much about where I am in my category strucutre anyways? Is there a way to

Your identity is what you identify with; what you consider yourself to be. For example, you could consider yourself open minded. You are willing to listen to new ideas and implement them if necessary. Funny enough, it is quite painful when someone challenges this, and can even cause cognitive dissonance. This means, instead of accepting their premise (that you are less open minded than you think) you actually hallucinate a justification (they don't understand the situtation). 

It can become an issue when you identify with something too specific. For example, if you consider yourself to be a 'strictly analog' musician (who will only play using expensive tube amps and analog equipment) things quickly become counter-productive when trying to play in a band, where digital (not analog) equipment is common. It would be more effective to identify with something more general, perhaps as a musician instead of an analog musician. 

But this can be extended even further. The issue is that you are putting yourself in a category, in a box. But as the Greek philosopher Heraclitus said, 'The only thing constant is change." Your environment will change, and perhaps considering yourself a musician in a few years will no longer be tenable. 

It can cause a lot of friction, and even failure, if you define yourself in a specific category. You will not want to change your category, and this failure to adapt can lead to disaster. A better solution is to identify with the constantly dying and resurrecting hero. The hero in a movie will have a flaw, and only by painfully overcoming this flaw (in a sense part of them dying and being reborn) will they be able to triumph. 

Once you no longer identify as a React programmer, and instead identify as the hero, that will actually affect how you perceive information. Just as category structures can affect how a team perceives information, in which category structure you place yourself has a strong effect on how you perceive the world. 

Identifying as the hero moves you outside the category structure, since you can objectively view the category structures and through careful attention choose where to place yourself in them, and how to modify them.

Fix the Process, Not the Problem.

Thoughts about the article

This is similar to the process that we used at Tinybop, although we never were able to fully articulate it there. We focused on improving processes and the environment, which when done pragmatically can naturally lead to something approximating this process.

I think I simply took the approach I was using to learn Japanese, and applied it to developing an app subconcisously. When learning a language, it often feels like debugging a computer program. I am not getting the result I am expecting, or I am getting a bad outcome, but I do not remotely know what is causing the problem. Generally a combination of problem solving, along with a healthy dose of guess and check is the way I used to solve these sorts of problems.

For example, I would tell a somewhat crude joke in Japanese. It would be totally acceptable and funny in English, but just doesn’t quite fly in Japanese. Through ‘debugging’ my interactions and jokes, I eventually realized that self-deprecating humor is much better in Japanese since it is ‘cool’ to be humble in Japanese. 

The ‘low resolution’ way that we looked at it was we ‘want to improve the processes to make the environment better.’

7 Commandments for a Successful Team

Thou shalt tell the truth, so ye can identify problems.

Thou shalt create a good atmosphere, so ye will communicate with each other.

Thou shalt eat humble pie. You can’t teach a man that knows everything. Assume team members know things that you don’t, and learn from them even if it’s really annoying.





To learn

You must tell the truth so you can identify problems as well as communicate.

You must create a good atmosphere, so team members will want to talk to you.

You must assume team members know things that you don’t, and that they can teach you something.




We must communicate so we can work together .

We must tell the truth so we know what the goal should be, as well as identify problems.

We must communicate, listen and speak, so we can network our minds together 


Learning to Learn

Cannot assume you know everything

A bit of chaos and experimentation must be allowed to exist

Team members must be allowed to try implementing things without permission

A sense of progress

A sense of purpose


Instead of fixing the problem fix what caused the problem



The atmosphere on a team is a result of how team members feel when interacting with each other, as well as progress towards a shared goal. Positivity and a sense of purpose seems to be the most important aspects in creating a good atmosphere.

The atmosphere of a team is created as a result of the personality of it’s members interacting with the processes, categorical 

Any team will have a specific atmosphere 




Create a Good Atmosphere
- Smile and be positive
- Be funny, bonus points if they're about yourself.
- love? Orient to opposite of hell, try to create

Learn, Humility
- Be humble enough to listen to others, and take what they say seriously. Assume they can teach you something. 
- You must be willing to sacrifice ideas that are not working, to be reborn into a more capable person. This is the path of the hero.

Continuous Improvement
- If you get 1% better every day, in two years you will be in an unimaginably good place. This is the miracle of compound interest.
- The rich get rich and the poor get poorer. This naturally happens because of the Pareto principle. As you push upwards to success, you will become exponentially more successful.  And vice versa. 

Communication
- Tell the truth. It's hard to communicate when you don't say what you think.
- If you stay silent about something, you will sacrifice the medium term for short term conflict aversion.

Truth
- Tell the truth, if you stay silent about something you know is wrong that is a form of lie. Doing otherwise will pollute your subconscious, warping it making it give you inaccurate information.
- Follow your hunch or conscience, they are usually correct.
