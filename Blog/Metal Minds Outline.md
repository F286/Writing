The conversion of our population into metal minds provided certain, advantages. Abilities that could only be described as supernatural.

Our ancestors feared AI, believing it's creation would eventually destroy them. They missed something far more dangerous however - themselves.

*Our genetics were the blueprint to our power, why this information was contained I do not know, there is much we do not understand. We were not evil men, simply determined.*

Could be that metal minds are robot intelligence that slowly replaces humans with mechanical parts. finally will replace brain too. Humans are all slowly becoming robots. The parts are much better than usual organs for function, e.g. mech eyes can see super far and also see metal, heat ect.. depending on type.

Can augment parts of the brain to do things like give telekenisis powers, Elund has this power. Can only lift what he could with his body though, line of sight. Normal humans can sometimes have very weak manifestations of this power (certain monks ect.. can train to do simple things like knock a pencil over) but AI augmentations can make this much more powerful.

Doens't have to be machine intelligence, there's faction of humans 'religion' that believes that it's humanity's destiniy to become fully robotic, including conversion of all brains to synthetic. 

And end of book would be cool if all humans have started conversion to synthetic, including main character? Maybe he is shot and dying, and the only way to save him is to work with 'enemy' throughout book to save him. e.g. Haven convinces Amon to save Elund by converting his brain to fully synthetic.

Using telekenisis power makes users extremely tired, often take booster drugs, caffeine to try and offset. Maybe other methods to reduce this.

### Theme 
Ship of Theseus, if you replace something piece by piece with something, is it the same thing or has it turned into something else?

As technology and culture progesses we gain obvious benefits, but do we lose things without realizing it? (a la baby with the bathwater syndrome). eg religion is gone, have we lost anything because of that?

Most people are oblivious to differences in cultures, so past and future culture would have a lot of issues interacting, which could be interesting.

An AI would have a vastly different way to thinking (maybe?) even if based off a human, so could have different goals and cultural differences.

### Character
Elend will do anything to further research at start, lacks strong moral courage even though has some misgivings. By end he will learn to respect life ect.. 

The main characters are metal minds! they are humans uploaded to metal minds.

Law when animal is uploaded to metal the original has to be killed. can't copy metal minds.

The country that Elend is in is global super power, opresses non metal mind people ect.. 


### Outline
In a modern society alien first contract happens, however it turns out the aliens are actually humans from the future. (they insist they aren't *actually* from the future, that would be impossible, they are from a parallel version of what the universe *could've* been.

The aliens rule society in a brutal 1984 esque style, with security cameras everywhere, but require that all humans follow a strict moral code of conduct. Similar to very strict religious sort of teaching.

Unknown to the population (aliens look just like humans) they're actually humans uploaded into 'metal minds', with superhuman capibilities because of it. But they are essentially human, and would not be able to tell the difference 

#### Start
MC wants to know more about the aliens. Most people hate the aliens, even though they don't hurt anyone. MC flaw is he lacks self control, will need to learn this by the end of the book.
