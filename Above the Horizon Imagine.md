# Above the Horizon Imagine

## What are the values that I am trying to convey with this story?

## What are the most important values (stories) that I have learned, that I could uniquely bring to the table?
_would be good to to something that is critically important but not necessarily widely known_

Create a good atmosphere
Your values have value
Your spouse’s values have value
Meaningful conversation negotiates a story
you can both live in
You see the world through your values
Your values have the structure of a story
A promise - a vision and expectation of the future
Never waste an opportunity to encourage those you love
This gives them the courage to move forward

You feel hollow when you ignore your conscience
Avoid this by listening to your conscience
“Hey, what do you think I should do now?”
Sit and wait for an answer. One will come.
Do that. To find out what happens is an adventure.
Do what my conscience tells me to do, in all things.

## What is unique to my way of thinking here, and what is it boiled out?

Humans see the world through their values, which have the structure of a story.
This story is a form of attention, it is (a) vision that creates the world we see from an extremely narrow abstraction of reality, with the dual outputs of imagining what we desire and physical embodied action.
Feeling hollow or worthwhile is the most accurate indicator that you are on the correct path.
The best way to find the path is to ask your conscience, wait for an answer, then do that.
Encourage those your love as it gives them the courage to move forward.

Each human can create the world through conversation, so has divine worth, so each of us has a responsibility to strive to love each other.
Values are paramount, they create the shared world that we live in.
Humans are mostly blind, out of necessity since we need to act, but confusing the world you see with reality can be dangerous.
Avoid what makes you feel hollow, and ask you conscience what to do to know where is worthwhile.
Encourage those you love to give them the courage to move forward.
 
The fact that what we see is not reality, that is what i need to transmit in this story. (We see reality filtered through our values, but not reality directly. This is ‘innoculation’ against ideologies)

We must also tell the truth, to be honest with each other.

Maybe this is Plato’s cave analogy. 

**Built in must be the implication for action (embodied)**

Walk towards your fear, you will succeed.
Be willing to die, live.
Speech creates the world.
Tell the truth, create a good world.

## Values for story

Each person creates the world through speech
Cannot see reality directly, but instead only through values
Confusion of the perceived world and reality leads to disaster
“Pride comes before a fall”

Each person’s values have value
By integrating perspectives, we can see infer a more complete view of reality
Marriage instead of conflict, this is how you can save those you love most

Walking through snowy streets in Japan, a lot of snow!
Wow it’s nice here
Get text to go back
Look up train
2.5 hours for destination, have to change trains
Looks complicated
..All you need is faith 
Wake up
realize i am back home, didn't need to do all that walking or spend time to get back.
