# Above the Horizon Imagine

## What are the values that I am trying to convey with this story?

## What are the most important values (stories) that I have learned, that I could uniquely bring to the table?
_would be good to to something that is critically important but not necessarily widely known_

Create a good atmosphere
Your values have value
Your spouse’s values have value
Meaningful conversation negotiates a story
you can both live in
You see the world through your values
Your values have the structure of a story
A promise - a vision and expectation of the future
Never waste an opportunity to encourage those you love
This gives them the courage to move forward

You feel hollow when you ignore your conscience
Avoid this by listening to your conscience
“Hey, what do you think I should do now?”
Sit and wait for an answer. One will come.
Do that. To find out what happens is an adventure.
Do what my conscience tells me to do, in all things.
